# Overview
This project aims to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) using deep learning techniques, specifically **EfficientNet-B2**, to classify fundus images into five severity levels.

# Features
- Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Model: Transfer learning with EfficientNet-B2.
- Optimization: Adam optimizer with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler.
- Evaluation: F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Grad-CAM visualization for explainability.

## Installation
Run the following command to install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
